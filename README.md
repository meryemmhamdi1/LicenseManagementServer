# LicenseManagementServer

### Acknoweldgements

This project was done in collaboration with teammate <b> Amine Ouahi </b> for cryptography class under the supervision of <b> Dr. Tajj-Eddine Rachidi </b>.

### Project Description

This is a license management server. This server grants license files for a
period of time to be used by applications, thus preventing application copying. Only application/program
instances/copies that have license files can run. The license file is authentic, non
transferable, and specific to one server/machine. This project uses an off-line license
control/verification with best encryption practices.
